              <h4>Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim</h4>
              <p>
                Education is the complete manifestation of human dignity. By proper education which based on the Quran and Sunnah a man can unfold himself fully as a pious Muslim. Markatuz Tahfiz International Madrasa has been established to achieve this goal . Science without religion is blind. Our institution is emphasising on science by the side of religious studies. English is no more considered merely a language rather it is a 'Tecnology' and to make our future generation competent enough in the international arena. There is no alternative but to master English language beside Arabic and Bangla. We aspire to mould up a foundation of knowledge on which todays generation would dare to place their firm step the hope snatching success and glory for themselves and for all. In this respect our students are going ahead with their brilliance and intelligence through proper knowledge.
                <br>
                To enrich the moral character of the students we regularly organize 'Akhlaq' and Motivational Programme. We shall also continue our effort to achive the highest in the desired field. Our motto is to sought the satisfaction of the Allah by creating some sort of structure where ethical and powerful leader will born and lead the future world.
                <br><br>
                Thanking you all.
                <br>
